<p class="text">The operation of a Orbital Research Station is a result of the excellent teamwork.<br>
    One cannot run the Orbital Research Station with only engineers on board or for that matter with only deck officers.<br>
    One of the most important ranks among deck officers is that of a Chief Officer, the head of deck department of the Orbital Research Station.<br>
    You will be one of the many management level officers on the ship who report directly to the captain and their second in command after the master of the ship.<br></p>
